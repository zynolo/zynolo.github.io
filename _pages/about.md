<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of Prof. Edward Chung. I am interested in modern AI technologies, especially for reinforcement learning and large language models, and hope to use them to tackle the challenging control and optimization problems in power and transportation system.

I have published some papers (8 in first author) at the top international AI conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, IJCAI, and AAAI, and on some Journals, like IEEE Trans and Applied Energy. I served as reviewers in ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, and IEEE Trans Journals.

I have a closed collaboration with a Start-up, MemOS. (https://memos.openmem.net/cn/)
